# linguistic-psychic
An old project in many flavors.

# The story
One of the first things I ever programmed was a simple game.

A letter from the alphabet would be randomly chosen, and the player had ten chances to guess what that letter was. I enjoyed learning how to get everything working (and then subsequently using it to mess with my friends since it was late March/early April).

Now, as I try to expand my knowledge base by learning more languages, I want to use something to reinforce my knowledge in those languages, and what better way to do that than with one of my first major milestones as a programmer?

# Versions available
- Python

# Hopefully coming soon
- Go
- Rust
- ...honestly, I don't even know what other versions of this I'd want to do, but I'm sure I'll find something in the future.

# Also in the future
For now, I'm doing these as simple Terminal applications - to play the game, you need to use your computer's Terminal window (or whatever it is for Windows).

I'd like to make these more accessible by making them web apps. Currently, I don't plan on trying to learn the tools to do that, but it is definitely something I can see happening down the line.

If you want to see the original version of this game, it can be found <a href="https://jamescalingo.dev/PsychicGame" target="blank">right here</a> and the GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JamesCalingo/PsychicGame).
