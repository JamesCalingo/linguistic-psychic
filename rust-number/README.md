# Rust

This is the version of the psychic game built with Rust. It's a bit more complex than other versions, partly due to it being based on the tutorial from *The Rust Programming Language* book/documentation. If you want to check that out, you can see it <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html" target="blank">here</a>.

It's also a little different in that you have to guess a number between 1 and 100 with unlimited guesses and every time you're wrong, you get pointed in the direction of the correct answer (i.e. whether your guess was more or less than the number itself).

I'm hoping to eventually have a version that's similar to the old game with the alphabet, but that may have to wait a bit given now complex this was...
